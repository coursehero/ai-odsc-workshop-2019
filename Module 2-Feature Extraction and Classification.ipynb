    "#### Workshop Description\n",
    "Understanding the questions posed by instructors and students alike plays an important role in the development of educational technology applications. In this intermediate level workshop, you will learn to apply NLP to one piece of this real-world problem by building a model to predict the type of answer (e.g. entity, description, number, etc.) a question elicits. Specifically, you will learn to:\n",
    "1. Perform preprocessing, normalization, and exploratory analysis on a question dataset,\n",
    "2. Identify salient linguistic features of natural language questions, and\n",
    "3. Experiment with different feature sets and models to predict the answer type.\n",
    "4. Use powerful pretrained language models to create dense sentence representations and apply deep learning models to text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts will be taught using popular NLP and ML packages like SpaCy, Scikit Learn, and Tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop assumes familiarity with Jupyter notebooks and the basics of scientific packages like numPy and sciPy. We also assume some basic knowledge of machine learning and deep learning techniques like CNNs, LSTMs, etc. Reference materials will be provided to gain a better understanding of these techniques for interested attendees.\n",

    "- ### Syntactic Features: \n",
    "Features that reflect the structure of our sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Word ngrams**: These are the length-n word sequences that occur in our data. Often, we add \"BOS\" and \"EOS\" tokens to mark the beginning and end of the sentence, respectively. For example, the \"bigrams\" (n=2) for the sentence \"This is an example\" would be {\"BOS this\", \"this is\", \"is an\", \"an example\", \"example EOS\"}. The order of `n` can be anything, though typically high orders of `n` result in such sparse features that they are no longer very useful. We will experiment with a few different values and ranges of `n`, and ultimately settle on \"unigrams\" (single words), and \"bigrams\" (pairs of adjacent words).\n",
    "  <u>Stopwords and Word ngrams</u>: Often, high-frequency words that serve a mostly functional purpose, eg. \"of\", \"the\", \"from\", are found to be of little help during text classification problems, and are thus removed from the text before ngram features are extracted. We can experiment with different sets of stopwords in our ngram-generation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. **Part-of-Speech ngrams**: The length-n sequences of syntactic classes (eg Noun, Verb, Preposition) can allow us to generalize key information about the language used in our data. Since the set of Part-of-Speech tags is significantly smaller than the number of unique words, this feature set is much less sparse than word n-grams and can help us find more general word-level patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. **Dependency Triples**: Often, pairs of non-adjacent words, despite being located in different parts of a sentence, have a syntactic relationship. For example, in the two sentences below, the relationship between \"What\" and \"say\" can be characterized as one of \"direct object\" in both, despite their different word orderings. These relationships cannot be captured by n-grams, which only focus on groups of adjacent words. Instead, we can use SpaCy's powerful Universal Dependency parser to extract these relationships, and encode them as features. For details about Universal Dependency relationships, see <https://universaldependencies.org/>\n",

    "**Exercise**: There are a number of interesting variations on the features we define here, as well as many other features that may prove valuable for this task. Use what you know about the data to try implementing your own features (Write feature functions that return a dict mapping <feature_value_name> to 1). For example, you can try replacing one of the words in each dependency triple with its Part-of-Speech (in SpaCy, you can get `<token>.pos_`).\n",

    "  In these examples, we should be able to detect that they are asking for the same answer type ('LOC'). One helpful technique is to use the Primary Noun Phrase head (\"ocean\" and \"lake\") both refer to places/bodies of water/physical entities. One nice way to do identify the similarities between these two NP heads is to use [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) for extraction the semantic relationships between the words.\n",
    "  In this case, once we identify the head of the Primary Noun Phrase, we would like to generalize it to its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponymy_and_hypernymy\">hypernyms</a>. One easy way to understand this is that a \"hyponym\" is a \"type of\" its hypernym. In the previous examples, both \"lake\" and \"ocean\" are types of \"body of water\", \"physical entities\", etc.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as identifying the \"primary Noun Phrase\" and its \"head\", we can use some simple, mostly-accurate heuristics (see <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1613835\">Question classification using head words and their hypernyms</a> for detailed discussion of this technique and some more advanced approaches that could improve your model). For present purposes, we will use the following simple definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "_The primary Noun Phrase of \"What\" (and some \"Who\") questions is the leftmost Noun chunk after the WH word. Its head is the right-most Noun in that chunk, ignoring Nouns embedded in Prepositional Phrases (The head Noun of \"The picture of friend\" would be \"picture\", not \"friend\")._"

This gives us a lower-variance, higher-confidence performance estimate than simply evaluating on a single held out set.

A simple example could be, instead of using one feature to represent a word form and another to represent its part-of-speech, try a conjunctive feature that contains both (eg instead of word unigram \"say\", and pos unigram \"VB\", you could make a single feature \"say//VB\"). \n",

We had some success using a Maximum Entropy model, but you may get some interesting results by using, for instance, a tree-based model instead. Ensemble methods, which use multiple classifiers to improve the final predictions, are also worth exploring here.\n",
